Kratom affects the opioid receptors, but it does not depress breathing, and likely is not as addicting  as real opiates. It can get people out of opiate withdrawals while not hooking them to the same level. Kratom has been found to decrease the symptoms of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease due to its MAOI alkaloids, and help with motivation for people who struggle with anxiety and depression.

Kratom is a naturally occurring tree in central Asia. There, its leaves have been chewed for centuries. Kratom is now used in the Western world to help people get off of opiates. It affects the opioid receptors of the brain without any affect on the central nervous system. Due to this, and the fact that it doesn't have such addictive properties as real opiates, its use has been on the rise for the treatment of various ailments. Kratom has been shown to help with chronic pain, [Parkinson's disease](https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/40tch8/what_kratom_has_done_for_my_parkinsons/) and various other mental and physiological problems.

### Controversy
Kratom is falling to a wave of propaganda, especially in the United States, where many news outlets and government authorities are falsely attributing the deaths of opiate users to Kratom. In every single case, the contents of the user's blood was not released, or had one or more known deadly drugs - mainly the ones Kratom helps them get off of.

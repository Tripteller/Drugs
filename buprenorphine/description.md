Buprenorphine is an opioid often used in combination with [Naloxone](drug/naloxone) (an opioid blocker) for those withdrawing or tapering off of strong opiates like [Heroin](/drug/heroin) and [Oxycodone](/drug/oxycodone). While not as popular, Buprenorphine and its Naloxone-containing forms can be used recreationally and produce a strong opiate-like high for those with no tolerance. For those with a tolerance to opiates, its effects will likely only be slightly felt, if at all.
